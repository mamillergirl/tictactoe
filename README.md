# Overview


This project was meant to teach me a about how C++ works and how to set up. It taught me a little about how the syntax is different from other progrmamming languages that I know.

This is a simple two player Tic Tac Toe game. A user inputes the space that they would like to mark. Then the players alternate turns until it is a draw or someone wins.

I thought that this would be a fun little game to do and it taught me the basics of how C++ works.
